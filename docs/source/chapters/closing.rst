Closing Remarks
===============

There is quite a lot that one could talk about for RDF, but there is no
need to talk about it all in one place. I hope this article was useful.
Comments are welcome.

Other good starting points for RDF are linked `from
here <http://dannyayers.com/archives/2005/10/03/semantic-web-starting-points/>`__.

If you want to program with RDF, grab `one of the many toolkits
available <http://www.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/suhl/bizer/toolkits/index.htm>`__
in many languages.

Many thanks to everyone on the semantic-web W3C mail list who provided
feedback on the initial post of this article!
